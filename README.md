# Bank Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing bank loan data to derive meaningful insights and create visualizations for better decision-making. The analysis focuses on various key performance indicators (KPIs) using Excel, MySQL, and Power BI.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: Used for initial data cleaning, merging datasets, and preliminary analysis.
- **MySQL**: Utilized for storing, querying, and analyzing data.
- **Power BI**: Employed for creating interactive and advanced visualizations.

## Datasets
The project involves two datasets named `finance_1` and `finance_2`. These datasets were merged and analyzed to derive insights.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. Grade and Sub-grade-wise Revolving Balance
2. Year-wise Loan Amount Statistics
3. Verified Status vs Non-Verified Payment Status
4. State Wise Loan Status
5. Month Wise Loan Status
6. Home Ownership vs Last Payment Date Statistics
7. Loan Term Distribution
8. Loan Amount to Income Ratio by Employment Length
9. Average Interest Rate by Loan Grade
10. Total Late Fees by Loan Purpose
11. Grade-wise Total Recoveries
12. Loan Amount by Location

## Visualizations
The data has been visualized using Power BI to provide an interactive experience and gain insights into the various KPIs. The visualizations include bar charts, line charts, and maps to effectively communicate the findings.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Excel for data cleaning, MySQL for data analysis, and Power BI for visualization. The KPIs provide valuable insights into loan performance, borrower characteristics, and other critical factors that can aid in decision-making processes.
